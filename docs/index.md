# Welcome to the ATLAS Documentation

This is a placeholder homepage for the proposed ATLAS docs structure. Feel free to explore. 

## What's the aim?

This new documentation structure is designed to improve navigation, provide user-focused content, and align with the data journey within ATLAS. Inspired by best-in-class documentation practices, it separates content by product and user type, ensuring that both standard users and developers can quickly find relevant information. The goal is to reduce reliance on support, enhance discoverability, and make it easier for users to understand and extend the ATLAS ecosystem.

Explore the sections to get started, distribute and capture data, process and visualize insights, and access developer resources.

> This site is currently under construction. Content will be added progressively.
