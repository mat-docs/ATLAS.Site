The ATLAS ecosystem is a powerful telemetry and data intelligence platform designed to support high-performance environments. Whether you're tuning a race car or validating aerospace systems, ATLAS provides the tools to ingest, analyse, and act on data in real time. Below are key use cases that illustrate how ATLAS is being applied across motorsport and engineering domains.

## Real-Time Telemetry for Competitive Edge in F1

In Formula 1, milliseconds matter. ATLAS enables teams to stream telemetry from ECUs, sensors, simulators, and wind tunnels with minimal latency. This real-time data flow allows engineers to monitor vehicle performance live during races or testing sessions. 

Teams use ATLAS to:

- Stream live telemetry from ECUs, sensors, and gearboxes.
- Analyse powertrain and gearbox performance in real time.
- Securely share configuration files and telemetry across consortium members using RDA licensing and encryption.

This ensures consistent control across hardware generations and protects proprietary data while enabling collaborative development.

## Formula E and Extreme E: Sustainability and Simulation

ATLAS powers telemetry and control systems for Formula E and Extreme E, supporting electric powertrains and sustainable racing initiatives. Use cases include:

- Battery management and diagnostics.
- Integration with MATLAB/Simulink for predictive modelling.
- Remote access to telemetry for offsite analysis.

These capabilities help teams optimise energy usage and performance under strict sustainability constraints.

## NASCAR: Custom Telemetry Recorder and GPS Integration

ATLAS has been tailored for NASCAR with a dedicated telemetry recorder that supports Vector GPS data and custom configuration formats. Teams benefit from:

- Real-time location tracking and performance overlays.
- Streamlined data ingestion compatible with ATLAS visualisation tools.

This adaptation allows NASCAR teams to leverage ATLASâ€™s precision analytics in a high-speed oval racing context.
