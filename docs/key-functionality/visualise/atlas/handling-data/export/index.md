# Overview

You can export sessions in multiple ways to suit your workflow.

To export an entire session directly from SQL Race to an SSN2 file, simply right-click the session in the Session Browser and select **Export**. Make sure the session is not currently loaded into a Set before exporting.

For more control—such as exporting specific parameters, laps, or using formats other than SSN2—use the [**Export Manager**](export-manager.md) found in the Tools menu.

The Export Manager lets you create and manage export configurations (see example below). To export, select the desired session from the **Session** dropdown (showing sessions loaded via the Session Browser), choose an export configuration, and click **Export**. The **Status** field will display progress as a percentage and update to **Done** when the export is complete.
