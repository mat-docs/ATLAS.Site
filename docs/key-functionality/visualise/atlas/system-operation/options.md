| Function Folder(s)                  | Specifies the directory where all user-defined Functions are loaded from and saved to. You can edit this path directly or browse to a folder. Changing this affects where ATLAS looks for and stores custom function scripts, which are used for data processing or automation.                                                                                                                                            | Functions           | C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\McLaren Electronic Systems\SQL Race\Functions                      |
| Constants Folder Location           | Sets the folder for loading and saving Constants, which are reusable values or parameters used in calculations or scripts. Like the Functions folder, this can be edited or browsed to. Ensures all constants are centralised for easier management and sharing.                                                                                                                                                | Functions           | C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\McLaren Applied Technologies\ATLAS 10\Constants                    |
| Resolve without App Name            | When enabled, allows parameters to be loaded from sources that use different Application Groups, so you can see and use channels even if the application names don’t match exactly. Useful for working with data from multiple sources or legacy systems.                                                                                                                    | Data                | Off by default                                                                                  |
| Parameter Properties in Compare mode| Determines how parameter properties (such as units, scaling, etc.) are inherited when comparing multiple sessions: <br>• **Primary Session**: Secondary sessions inherit properties from the primary session.<br>• **User Defined**: Local changes to secondary session properties are retained.<br>• **Default Data**: Properties stored within each session are loaded. Useful for ensuring consistency or flexibility in data comparison. | Data                | User selects mode                                                                              |
| Recent Workbook Max Count           | Sets the maximum number of recent Workbooks shown in the File > Recent Workbooks menu, making it easier to quickly reopen frequently used files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Workbook            | 15                                                                                             |
| Load Sessions with Workbooks        | If enabled, when you open a Workbook, all sessions that were loaded when it was last closed are automatically reloaded. This helps restore your previous working context.                                                                                                                                                                                                | Workbook            | Checkbox                                                                                       |
| Open Last Workbook when Starting    | When enabled, ATLAS will automatically reopen the last opened or saved Workbook at startup, streamlining workflow continuity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Workbook            | Checkbox                                                                                       |
| Auto Fit Laps                       | In Compare Sets with multiple laps, this option aligns the start and end of each lap on the X-axis in the Waveform Display, making it easier to visually compare laps of different durations.                                                                                                                                                                           | Workbook            | Checkbox                                                                                       |
| Auto Fit Limit %                    | Sets the maximum percentage difference between laps that Auto Fit will stretch data to match. Prevents excessive distortion when aligning laps. Default is 5%.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Workbook            | 5%                                                                                            |
| Load Recorders From                 | Determines whether saved Recorder configurations are loaded from the Workbook (unique to each file) or from a Local Configuration file (shared across all Workbooks). Useful for managing how recording setups are reused.                                                                                                                                              | Workbook            | LocalConfiguration                                                                             |
| Remove set when last session unloaded| If enabled, deletes the current set when the last session is removed from it (except the final set). Helps keep the workspace tidy by removing empty sets.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Workbook            | Checkbox                                                                                       |
| Workbook Folder Enabled             | Allows you to specify a dedicated folder for storing Workbook files, improving organisation and backup management.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Workbook            | Checkbox                                                                                       |

| Application Insights (Allow collection of Metrics and Error data) | When enabled, this option allows ATLAS to share performance metrics and logged exceptions with McLaren Applied for product improvement and troubleshooting. No personally identifiable information (PII) is shared. This helps McLaren Applied monitor application health and usage trends, but preserves user privacy.                                                                                                   | Metrics   | Off by default. Toggle as needed for support or analytics.                                      |
| ATLAS Logging Level                 | Sets the level of detail for log messages written to ATLAS log files. Each level includes all levels below it:<br>• **Trace**: Extremely detailed logs, including code execution paths and algorithm steps. Intended for development or deep troubleshooting.<br>• **Debug**: Detailed logs for debugging, including variable states and configuration.<br>• **Info**: Logs significant events indicating normal operation (e.g., service start/stop).<br>• **Warn**: Logs events that could become issues if not addressed (e.g., high resource use).<br>• **Error**: Logs significant problems that affect operations but do not stop the application (e.g., failed API calls).<br>• **Off**: Disables logging entirely. | Logging   | Default is Info. Trace is only recommended for support/development.                             |
| Logfile Path                        | Specifies the folder where ATLAS log files are stored. You can set this to any accessible directory. Useful for organising logs or directing them to a monitored location for support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Logging   | User-defined.                                                                                   |
| Max Archive Files                   | Sets the maximum number of archived log files to keep alongside the current active log file. When the limit is reached, the oldest archives are deleted. This helps manage disk space while retaining recent log history for troubleshooting.                                                                                                                                | Logging   | Default is 9.                                                                                  |
| Archive Above Size                  | Sets the file size threshold (in bytes) at which a log file is archived and a new log file is started. Prevents log files from growing too large. Default is 10MB (10,485,760 bytes).                                                                                                                                                | Logging   | Default is 10MB (10485760 bytes).                                                              |
| SQL Race Logging Level              | Sets the logging level specifically for SQL Race data, using the same levels as ATLAS Logging Level (Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Off). Allows for separate control of logging detail for SQL Race operations, which may be useful for diagnosing database-related issues.                                                                                              | Logging   | Default is Info.
