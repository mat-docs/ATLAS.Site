# Parameters

Parameters are physical properties that are measured during a Session. Typically, a parameter value is the conditioned signal output of a sensor. Each parameter generates data which is available for display.

Parameters may be combined using Functions to give derived results. The output of a Function can be manipulated and displayed in the same way as a parameter.

Each parameter has a set of properties associated with it that control how it is presented in a Display. These can be edited in the Parameter Properties panel. Functions also have Properties.

Parameters are classified into Groups, aimed at simplifying their organization. Parameter Groups are defined in the data logging system and cannot be changed in ATLAS. Parameter groups are listed in the Parameter Browser.
