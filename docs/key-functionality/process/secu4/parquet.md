## Historical Data Storage (Parquet)
In addition to the ATLAS session formats, a Parquet format will be supported for storing
open engineering data directly from the stream or as an export from ATLAS.
Parquet is an open-source file format for storing large datasets in an optimized way. 
Columnar storage allows for fast data processing and good compression rates. Parquet 
files can be easily accessed using a variety of programming languages and APIs, to allow
teams to access their data independent of ATLAS.
