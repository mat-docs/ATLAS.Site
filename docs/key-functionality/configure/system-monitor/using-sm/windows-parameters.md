## Windows

System Monitor supports multiple window types for displaying and interacting with parameters.

### Editable Windows
Used to view and modify calibration parameters. These windows display parameter names, current values, units, and status indicators. Changes can be made directly in the value fields.

Each type of Editable Parameter has a specific type of Window. The following types of Editable Parameter are supported:

- Scalar
- 1-axis map
- 2-axis map
- Array
- String

### Measurement Windows

Used to monitor real-time data from sensors and ECUs. These windows can display values numerically or graphically (e.g. strip charts, bar graphs).

The data from Measurement Parameters can be displayed in the following types of display:

- Big Number
- Numeric
- Bar Graph
- Oscilloscope
- Grid

### Creating Windows

New windows can be created via the Desktop menu. Users can choose the window type and assign parameters during creation.

### Window Properties

Each window has configurable properties:

- **Title**: Custom name for the window
- **Colours**: Background and text colour settings
- **Axis Settings**: For graphical windows, axis ranges and labels can be defined
- **Update Rate**: Determines how frequently data is refreshed

### Window Types

- **Numeric Display**: Shows parameter values in a grid
- **Strip Chart**: Plots values over time
- **Bar Graph**: Displays values as vertical bars
- **Gauge**: Simulates analogue gauge behaviour
- **Status Indicator**: Shows boolean or state-based parameters

## Parameters
Parameters are central to System Monitor’s functionality. They are either editable (calibration) or measurement (read-only):

- Editable Parameters
The information used by the embedded control system in the ECU to control its performance. Also known as Configurable or Tune data. Examples are: fuel injection quantity look-up tables; engine idle speeds; ignition maps; etc. Tuning is the process of optimising the values of Editable Parameters

- Measurement Parameters
The information gathered by the ECU from sensors or generated by its own operation. Also known as On-Line information. Examples are: engine speed; water temperature; etc. Logging or Data Acquisition is the process of obtaining this information. System Monitor includes tools to control Logging.

### Editable Parameters


Any aspect of an ECU that can be changed in System Monitor is made available as an Editable Parameter. The type of Parameter is defined in the ASAP file by the ECU manufacturer. The ASAP file also permits or prevents System Monitor from changing the values of the Parameter. Editable parameters can be modified and sent to the ECU. They include:

- **Name**
- **Current Value**
- **Units**
- **Limits**
- **Status** (e.g. locked/unlocked)

Changes are made in editable windows and transmitted via the ECU menu.

### Measurement Parameters

These are read-only values received from the ECU or sensors. They are used for monitoring system behaviour and performance.

### Parameter Properties

Each parameter includes metadata:

- **Data Type**: Integer, float, boolean, etc.
- **Units**
- **Conversion**: Raw to engineering units
- **Update Rate**
- **Display Format**

### Virtual Parameters

Users can define virtual parameters using mathematical expressions. These are useful for derived metrics or combining multiple inputs.

### Parameter Explorer

A tool for browsing all available parameters. Supports filtering by name, type, and source. Parameters can be dragged into windows for display or editing.
