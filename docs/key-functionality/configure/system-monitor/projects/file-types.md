# Project File Structure

System Monitor uses several different files in the following categories:

- [ECU Files](#ecu-files) - Embedded software files distributed by the TAG customer support team or by the ECU manufacturer. Not part of System Monitor.
- [Program and Data Version Files](#program-and-data-version-files) - The System Monitor working files. Generated by System Monitor from the ECU files.
- [Project Files](./file-operations.md/#exporting-and-importing-files) - Files generated by System Monitor to store its own configurations.

System Monitor stores project files in a structured directory layout under the Multi-Application Base.

## Directory Layout

```
\MultiAppName\
├── CustBaseName\
│   └── version\
│       ├── version.pgv
│       └── version000.dtv
├── Desktops\
│   └── ProjectName.dtp
├── LogCfgs\
├── Sessions\
├── Virtuals\
├── Work\
├── SenSets\
├── HistReps\
└── ProjectName.prj
```

### Description

- **MultiAppName**: Top-level directory for the Multi-Application Base
- **CustBaseName**: Sub-directory for each Application
- **version**: Contains Program and Data Version files
- **Desktops**: Stores Desktop files
- **LogCfgs**: Default location for logging configurations
- **Sessions**: Stores session logs from Live Logging
- **Virtuals**: Stores virtual parameter files
- **Work**: Stores event logs
- **SenSets**: Stores sensor and actuator configurations
- **HistReps**: Stores history report files
- **ProjectName.prj**: Main project file

Each new project creates its own `.prj` file and associated subdirectories.

## Program and Data Version Files

The Program and Base Data Version files are generated by System Monitor when a New Program Version is created.

### Program Version File (.pgv)

Encapsulates all program-related artifacts for a program version.

- Typical contents (generated by System Monitor):
    - Full content of the ASAP2 (.a2l) file.
    - Program code for each ECU controller (from the HEX file).
    - The content of any additional files selected during creation.
    - Unique program version stamp (version).
    - Base directory and program version directory and filename.
    - ECU type and names of the original .hex and .a2l files.
    - Free-form comment/notes.

### Base Data Version File (.dtv)

Contains the base set of calibration/data values and related metadata.

- Typical contents:
    - Data for each controller forming the base parameter set (from HEX).
    - Data-area memory layout (from ASAP2).
    - Short and long comments/notes and the creating user name.
    - Unique stamp linking to the associated .pgv (program version).
    - Base directory, program version directory and filename.
    - Unique data version stamp and the default filename (version000.dtv).

## ECU Files

ECU files are the embedded software files for the ECU, distributed by the customer support team or by the ECU manufacturer. Not part of System Monitor.

- Required by System Monitor:
    - ASAP2 (.a2l) — ASAP2 project/description file required for mapping parameters and memory layout.
    - HEX (.hex) — compiled program + data; provides program code and controller data.
    - Controllers (.ini) — controller list and per-controller properties/IDs.

- Optional (may be supplied by customer support or manufacturer):
    - Errors (.ini), Events (.ini), Adjustment Parameters (.ini)
    - Sensors (.ini), Sensor Injector (.ini)
    - Sensor Enable/Disable (.ini)
    - Sensor PRM (.prm) — paths/filenames for ASCII calibration data
    - Live Auto Tune (.ini) — tuning-related configuration (TBC)

### File Content

- ASAP2 (.a2l)
    - Project name/security reference and ECU type.
    - Version string used for naming/version directory.
    - Definitions for measurement and editable parameters, groups, conversion formulas, axes, and memory location information for controllers and parameters.

- HEX (.hex)
    - Program code for each ECU controller.
    - Controller configuration including revision/date/data-version stamps and data area sizes/locations.
    - Base data values used as the initial calibration set.

- Controllers (.ini)
    - Defines the list of controllers (including possible external controllers), their names, IDs, ident numbers (for cross-reference to ASAP2), and controller properties.

- Sensors and Related Files
    - Sensors (.ini) — lists available sensor types and selected sensors; defines sensor data memory for controllers.
    - Sensor Enable/Disable (.ini) — sensors that can be toggled on/off by ECU.
    - Sensor PRM (.prm) — links to ASCII calibration files for sensors.
    - Live Auto Tune (.ini) — placeholder for live autotune configuration details.
