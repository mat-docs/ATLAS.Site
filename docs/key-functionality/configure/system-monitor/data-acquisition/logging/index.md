# Logging Overview
System Monitor provides comprehensive tools to configure how data is logged by an ECU or other data logging device. Logging is the process of acquiring data from measurement parameters and storing it for analysis, either live or post-session.

## Logging Categories

System Monitor supports three main logging methods:

- [**Live Logging**](live-logging.md): Sends data directly to System Monitor via wirelink, without storing it in the ECU.
- [**Remote Logging**](remote-logging.md): Stores data in DATALab memory for later upload.
- [**Burst Logging**](burst-logging.md): Stores high-frequency data in Burst memory, also used for Wide Band Telemetry.

Each method has its own configuration tools and session management features.

## Memory Allocation
TAG systems use two types of memory for data logging:

### Burst Memory
- Designed for high-speed logging of engine parameters.
- Triggering is simple and data is collected at the highest rate supported by the hardware.
- Configured via the Burst Logging configuration.

### DATALab Memory
- Used for chassis parameters that require lower sampling rates.
- Offers versatile triggering and configurable sampling rates.
- Configured via the Remote Logging configuration.

## Session Generation
Sessions represent the data collected during a test or race. They can be generated in three ways:

### Live
If the ECU is On-Line (in a testbed situation for example), a Session file can be generated which is suitable for analysis by ATLAS. The characteristics of the Session file are set using the Live Logging configuration.

!!! note
    The Session data generated by System Monitor Version 7 is a single file in the format used by ATLAS Version 7. It is not compatible with ATLAS Version 6, which uses a different format.

### Upload
If Data Logging is used, System Monitor can configure the ECU to choose the parameters to be included in the session as well as the trigger and sample rate characteristics.

System Monitor does not have any direct involvement in generating the Session files. They are created by uploading the data from the ECU into ATLAS.

### Telemetry
Data is transmitted from a moving vehicle during the test session. System Monitor does not have any direct involvement in generating the Session files. ATLAS receives the data and analyses it live. ATLAS generates a Session file when Telemetry stops.

TAGtronic systems support two types of telemetry:

- **Narrow Band (Continuous)**: Low data rate telemetry that sends data continuously using low frequency radio. System Monitor is not used to configure this type of telemetry.
- **Wide Band (Burst)**: High data rate telemetry that sends data in bursts using high frequency (Microwave) radio. Data is logged into the Burst Memory, the contents of which are transmitted in each burst. System Monitor is used to configure this type of telemetry using the Burst Logging configuration.
