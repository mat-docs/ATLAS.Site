# Overview

System Monitor is a software application for interfacing with Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and related systems. It supports trackside support, unit optimisation, dyno testing, development, and production. The application is optimised for TAGtronic systems but can be adapted for third-party controllers with hardware modifications.
