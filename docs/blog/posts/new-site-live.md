# New Documentation Site Now Live!

Welcome to the new Documentation Site for the ATLAS Product Suite.

<!-- more -->

We’ve redesigned the structure of the ATLAS documentation based on user feedback that information was difficult to locate. The new site makes it easier to search across the full ATLAS suite and find what you need quickly.

## What's New?

- **Unified Search:** Multiple documentation sources have been consolidated into one searchable site for faster, more accurate results.

- **Clear Structure:** API documentation is now separated from user guides, making it easier to navigate based on your needs.

- **Product-Specific Areas:** Each product in the suite has its own dedicated section, so you no longer need to guess where content might be hidden.

## What's Coming Up?

We’re actively expanding the site to cover all ATLAS products and improve on the quality of documentation. Expect new sections and updated guides to appear regularly.

Your feedback is always appreciated. It helps us improve and evolve the documentation to better serve your needs.
