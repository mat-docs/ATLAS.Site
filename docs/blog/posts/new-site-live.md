# New Documentation Site Now Live!

Welcome to the new Documentation Site for the ATLAS Product Suite.

<!-- more -->

We have spent some time redesigning the structure of the ATLAS documentation site based off feedback from users that documentation is hard to find. This redesign makes it easier to search across the full ATLAS suite for information. 

## What's New?

- We have combined several sites together into one so you can search across the written documentation that has been produced and retrieve results faster.
- We have adjusted the structure of the documentation to separate API documentation from user guides. 
- Each product in the product suite has it's own respected area, making it easier to find information you need without having to guess the header it was written under. 

## What's Coming Up?

As we continue to expand on the documentation to cover all ATLAS products, you will see new sections appear and new guides in existing products. 

Feedback is always appreciated.
